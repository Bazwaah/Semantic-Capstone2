# Semantic Capstone

A clean, accessible portfolio project built with semantic HTML5 and custom CSS. This capstone highlights my focus on structure, clarity, and user-centered design—with a strong emphasis on clean code and responsive layout.

## 🔍 Project Focus
This version (Semantic Capstone) is separate from Capstone 1 and 2 to clearly showcase best practices in:
- Semantic HTML
- Accessible form structure
- Custom CSS styling (inspired by Tailwind but handcrafted)
- Responsive design with flex layouts and media queries

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (minimal, just for form UX)
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## 📁 File Structure
- `index.html` – Home page with hero section and CTA
- `about.html` – Personal summary
- `contact.html` – Accessible form with keyboard support and validation
- `css/style.css` – Fully custom styles, mobile-first responsive
- `images/` – Owl avatar and brand assets

## ✍️ Notes
This is a learning-focused build to sharpen my semantic layout approach and user-friendly markup. Built and deployed as a refined version—distinct from Capstone 1 and Capstone 2—to reflect improved structure and best practices.
